# Web scraping data from the Jumia website and saving it to a SQL database and CSV file.
- - Here, I provide code and illustrate how to scrape data from a website using the BeautifulSoup and **lxml** Python libraries. **lxml** is chosen as the parser for BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content of the webpage, this is because **lxml** is faster than the default Python parser (html.parser).
- - The scraped data is then saved to a **MySQL** database and **CSV File**.

ðŸ’¡First we import the required libraries/dependencies
